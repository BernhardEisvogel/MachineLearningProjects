# Machine Learning Projects
This site contains various small machine learning projects.

1. Word Language Classificator: This model tries to guess the language of a word. It works fairly well on longer words. Just start startMe.sh and try it out. The data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacekpardyak/languages-of-europe and some personally compiled language files which are mostly from sentences stripped word data (this part has lower quality).

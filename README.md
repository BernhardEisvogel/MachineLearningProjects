# Machine Learning Projects
This site contains various small machine learning projects.

1. Word Language Classificator: This model tries to guess the language of a word. It works fairly well on longer words. Just start startMe.sh and try it out!

The data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacekpardyak/languages-of-europe and some personally compiled language files which are mostly stripped words from a sentence databse (this part has lower quality).

2. Unsupervised Audio Classificatio: This programm classifies audio data without supervision. It works really well on the ESC-50 Dataset.  Start main.py to try it out, the dataset (1.5GB) is automatically downloaded.

3. Binance Trading Bot. This program reads Binance Trading Data and tries to predict the stock value with an LSTM. Doesn't work properly (as expected), because there's no way to predict stock prices.
